Playing around with CSS animations and jQuery. 

Just a few little toys and experiments around CSS and jQuery. Learning some of the animation effects in CSS3.

* pulley.htm - Background movement relative to browser position.
* wipe.htm - Easing functions in CSS3.
* neon.htm - Neon effects with text-shadows.
* text-shadows.html - Movements with text-shadows. Going for a 'sun-moving' effect, but not quite there yet.
* gradients-animations.html - A bit of a mix. Hover over the tabs for animations and multipled backgrouns. Orange and the header is experiments with CSS gradients.
* card-shadows.html - Bouncing card effect
